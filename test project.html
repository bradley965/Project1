   <h1> The Terrors of Ankylosing Spondylitis</h1>
   <p> What is Ankylosing Spondylitis? 
Ankylosing Spondylitis is a type of arthritis that over time, can fuse the spine. Often when this happens, you get what is known as a “hunchback”. This type of arthritis is not easy to identify and may take months or even years to identify. I had to see multiple medical providers before they figured out what was going on. I will give you a few things to look out for.</p>
   <h2> Some symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis</h2>
   <ul>
    <ol>Pain in lower back</ol>
    <ol>Worse when you lay down to rest or wake up</ol>
    <ol>Sciatica</ol>
    <ol>Fatigue</ol> 
    <ol>Back pain that wakes you up</ol>

   <h2>Things to know</h2>
    <p2>Ankylosing spondylitis is hard to diagnose. It will make you think you are going crazy after a while of not getting diagnosed. It is a very tricky thing because it will start by coming in waves. You will have some really good days, or even weeks or months. Then out of nowhere, you will not be able to lift your legs into the tub, bend over, or sneeze without feeling excruciating pain. Something I should add is, unlike normal arthritis that shows more at an older age, AS will show up in your early to mid-20s. So that should be something to keep in mind if you are in pain all the time. You will want to have your doctor test you for the HLA-B27 gene. This gene is only in about %50 of people with AS, but, if you're like me, it will help bring answers to why you are always in pain.</p2>
    <h3>You are not the only one</h3>
    <p3>Ankylosing Spondylitis is a non-curable disease that causes lifelong pain. This can be managed through medications and exercise. However, sometimes, this is not enough. Pain can cause crazy thoughts in your head especially if the pain doesn’t go away. Here are some resources if you ever feel like giving up the fight on Ankylosing Spondylitis. </p3>
